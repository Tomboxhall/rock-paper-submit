## Structure

The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock JavaScript game follows a well-organized and modular structure to ensure clarity and maintainability. The project is divided into three main files: **index.html**, **style.css**, and **script.js**. The HTML file (index.html) serves as the entry point, providing the structural foundation for the game interface. It incorporates distinct sections for Player 1, the Computer, and the game results, creating a clean and visually appealing layout.

The styling of the game is handled by the CSS file (style.css). The styles are structured to enhance the user experience, featuring a space-themed background and clear differentiation between player and computer sections. The Player selections also have a **Hover:Grow** effect on them to visually let the player know which choice they are hovering over. 

The core functionality and game logic are encapsulated in the JavaScript file (script.js). The script is well-commented, making it easy to understand and maintain. It includes event listeners for player and computer choices, functions for displaying choices and results, score tracking, and a reset functionality. The use of functions and modular coding principles enhances readability and allows for potential future enhancements.

Overall, the structure of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game follows best practices for web development, promoting maintainability, scalability, and ease of collaboration.
